        <intro>
Phase I and phase II metabolic reactions often work together to assist in the removal of xenobiotics from the body.  Explain how these reactions cooperate to remove drugs from the bloodstream.

        <intro>
The liver is a primary organ for drug metabolism.  In cases of drug overdoses, the liver is often at risk to be damaged by drug metabolites.  Discuss in general terms how the liver can be vulnerable to the metabolites that it makes.

        <intro>
A drug is dosed so that its concentration in the body remains above the minimum effective concentration and below the maximum tolerated dose.  Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window require very careful dosing.  Discuss how genetic variations among people makes the design of safe and effective drugs with a narrow window particularly challenging.
