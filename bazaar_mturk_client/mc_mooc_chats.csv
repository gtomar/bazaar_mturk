I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

In any course, a major challenge it to target the material at a level and with a focus that is just right for the variety of students who come.  Based on your experience so far this week, how would you rate the match between what the course offers and what you wanted and expected from it?\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\

In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\

I'm Virtual Erland. Each week we will have a chat activity in which you will have the opportunity to reflect back on what you have learned during the week.  After this week, you will start each week with a question to get you thinking about the content.  After you have worked through the material, you can think back on how your answer to that question will change because of what you learned.  This week, we’ll use this time to get acquainted.\

As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?\
