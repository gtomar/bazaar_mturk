        <intro>
In week 1, we started to lay a foundation for the material in this course.  We are just scratching the surface so far.  As we’re working towards getting into more substantive content going forward, it would be great to hear what specific goals you have for what you want to learn in this course.  Can you tell me a little about that?

In any course, a major challenge it to target the material at a level and with a focus that is just right for the variety of students who come.  Based on your experience so far this week, how would you rate the match between what the course offers and what you wanted and expected from it?
