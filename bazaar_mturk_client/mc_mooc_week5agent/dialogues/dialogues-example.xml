        <intro>
The energy that holds a drug to its target is often approximately 11 kcal/mol.  What interactions make up the source of this binding energy?

        <intro>
Despite potentially being fairly large molecules, drugs normally have a well-defined shape. Discuss how the particular shape of a molecule is relevant to the drug’s binding to a target.

        <intro>
The number of molecules that could possibly be considered as oral drug molecules is difficult to comprehend.  A challenge for chemistry is to generate libraries of molecules that sample drug space as a starting point for drug discovery.  Comment on how combinatorial chemistry helps to achieve this goal and yet also has limited success in this area.

And now we’re done. Thanks for joining us, have a great day! I will now continue the chat activity again starting from the first prompt for those who missed the initial prompts.
